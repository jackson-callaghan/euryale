A character sheet manager/editor written in python

## Motivation

I don't like most ways I've worked with character sheets in the past, and I like having things handled for me. Also I want to be able to export my sheet in a way that's not a pain for others.

## Roadmap

1. Store and retrieve information from json file via command line

2. Display and edit basic info with minimal calculation

3. Output to form-fillable pdf

4. Action, resource, turn management with calculations and optional auto-dice

5. Support for custom modifiers through feats and magic items

6. More user-friendly creations and editing tools for character, items, feats, etc

7. Some fancy polish and general ease-of-use

8. Create gem.dynamic and redesign to use it


## Important considerations

- Log file which allows for undoing of actions
