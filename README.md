A character sheet manager/editor written in python

## Motivation

I don't like most ways I've worked with character sheets in the past, and I like having things handled for me. Also I want to be able to export my sheet in a way that's not a pain for others.

## Roadmap

1. Store and retrieve information from json file via command line

2. Calculations for more complicated stats

3. Modifier system for JSON-defined items/feats/etc

4. Basic Command-line interface

5. Output to pdf

6. More user-friendly creations and editing tools for character, items, feats, etc

7. Refine API for connecting to a UI

8. Create either a TUI or GUI (or both) using existing cross-platform libraries.


## Important considerations

- Log file which allows for undoing of actions
